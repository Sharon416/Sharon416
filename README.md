Hello there! 
My name is Sharon Sanchez. I am a student from California State University, Northridge majoring in Sociology. I was formerly a computer science major where I have experience in web development. 
I am currently working and learning about data analysis where I plan to go to grad school for sociology with a potential specialization in computational sociology using quantitative methods. So, I have come to enjoy 
working behind the scenes in analysizing data and working with numbers! I hope to add on to my skillset and contribute to future projects! 
I hope to update this page in the future!
